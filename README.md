In your configuration.yaml file, add the custom sensor configuration:

```
noaa_integration:

## Summary:

Kp Index gives a short-term, planetary average of geomagnetic activity, updated every 3 hours, and is used for global monitoring of geomagnetic disturbances.

Dst Index (and similar geomagnetic storm measurements) provides a longer-term measure of geomagnetic storm intensity, particularly during storms, and is focused on the effects of the ring current in Earthâ€™s magnetosphere.
